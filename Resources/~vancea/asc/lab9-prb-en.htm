<strong>Laboratory 9 - problems</strong><br><br>

For the following problems it is required to write at least one subprogram in a separate module.<br><br>

1. A number <em>a</em> represented on 16 bits is given. Print on the screen <em>a</em> in base 16, as well as the result of all circular permutations of the digits. <br><br>

2. Read from the standard input a string of numbers, given in base 10.<br><br>

3. Two character strings are given. Compute and print on the screen the result of the concatenation of the second string after the first one, and also of the first string after the second one.<br><br>

4. A string of numbers is given. Print on the screen the values in base 16.<br><br>

5. Read the numbers a, b and c and compute and print on the screen a+b-c.<br><br>

6. Three character strings are given. Compute and print on the screen the result of their concatenation.<br><br>

7. Three character strings are given. Print on the screen the longest prefix for each of the three pairs of two strings that can be formed.<br><br>

8. Print of the screen, for each number between 32 and 126, the value of the number (in base 10) and the character whose ASCII code the number is.<br><br>

9. Read from the standard input a string of numbers, given in base 16.<br><br>

10. Print of the screen, for each number between 32 and 126, the value of the number (in base 16) and the character whose ASCII code the number is.<br><br>

11. Read several character strings from the stardard input. Print a message on the screen if the first string appears as sequence in all the other strings. <br><br>

12. Read from the standard input several numbers, in base 2. Print on the screen these numbers in base 16.<br><br>

13. Two character strings of equal length are given. Compute and print on the screen the result of their two posible intercalations (the characters from the first string on even positions, and then the characters from the first string on odd positions).<br><br>

14. Three character strings are given. Print on the screen the longest suffix for each of the three pairs of two strings that can be formed.<br><br>

15. Read from the standard input several numbers, in base 2. Print on the screen these numbers in base 10.<br><br>

<strong>Observations</strong><br><br>

1. <em>Is given</em> means that data is given in the data segment;<br><br>
2. The numbers are unsigned, represented on 16 bits, if no other specification is given; the character strings have at most 100 characters.<br><br>
