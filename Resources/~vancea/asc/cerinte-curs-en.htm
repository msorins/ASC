<h2>Seminar and Laboratory activity</h2>
<p>
Seminar activity is REQUIRED with respect to a minimum of 75% in accordance with University and Faculty regulations. 
As a result, there are allowed maximum 2 UNMOTIVATED absences. in the seminar. Also, there are allowed maximum 2 UNMOTIVATED absences for the lab. 
No exemption based on extra school activities like jobs, etc. are permitted.
In special cases, students can attend the seminar/laboratory they missed in the current week with a different group/subgroup if the teaching assistant in charge with that seminar/laboratory agrees.
</p>
<p>
<u><b>Students with more than 2 UNMOTIVATED absences from seminar or laboratory will not be able to take the exam in both regular examination session or in the reexamination session 
(seminar and laboratory activities can not be recovered or repeated during reexamination session 
(these students will have to repeat this course in the next academic year). Students with medical certificates for each of their absences are exempted from this rule.</b></u>
</p>
<p>Each laboratory task must be handed in by a specific deadline, deadline which will be known by the student 
when he/she gets the task. For each task, a waiting period of 2 weeks, after the deadline, is set.
If the student hands in the laboratory task in the waiting period, the grade he/she gets is diminished by
2 points for each week of delay. After the passing of the 2-weeks waiting time, the task can no longer be
handed in to the professor, and the student gets the grade 1 for that specific laboratory task.
</p>
<p>
The grade for a specific laboratory task is assigned by the professor in charge of the laboratory work for each group
after the student presents a program solving that task.
The criteria for establishing this grade are:
<ul class="nice_list">
<li>the student must prove the solution works</li>
<li>the quality, efficiency and clarity of the source code and also of the accompanying documentation (comments and explanations
of the way the solution was developed).</li>
<li>correctness and smartness of the program developed by the student</li>
<li>ability of the student to easily transform the program and adapt it for solving related problems</li>
</ul>

The final grade for the laboratory activity is computed as an arithmetic average of the grades obtained by the
student for each laboratory task (a task not handed in is graded with 1). <u><b>The student can take the practical examination
only if the average grade is at least 5 and if the student had enough attendances at laboratory classes.</b></u>
</p>
</div>
<div class="bordertop">
<h2>Mid-term practical test</h2>
Saturday, December 10th, starting with 10 am, a mid-term practical test will take place. The subjects students need to know
for this test will be specified during the courses. <u>This mid-term practical test is mandatory for all students</u>. <u><b>This activity can not be recovered or repeated during examination/reexamination session. </u></b>

</div>
<div class="bordertop">
<h2>Practical examination:</h2>

The practical examination will take place between 9th and 20th of January 2017, at the laboratory. The
student is allowed to take the written exam from the examination session only if the grade for the practical
examination is at least 5.
Otherwise the student can take the written exam only in the reexamination session. We will consider for the final grade the practical test score obtained during 9 to 20 January 2017.
THE PRACTICAL EXAMINATION CANNOT BE REPEATED!
</p>

</div>
<div class="bordertop">
<h2>Written exam:</h2>
In order to pass this exam, the student must get a grade that is at least 5.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bordertop important">
<h2>Final grade</h2>
The final grade for the Computing Systems Architecture course will be computed using the following rule:<br/>
<ul class="nice_list">
<li>15% the average grade received for the laboratory work </li>
<li>15% the grade received for the mid-term practical test</li>
<li>15% the grade received at the practical examination </li>
<li>55% the grade received for the written exam </li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<div class="bordertop">
<p><b>For students who failed this course in the past and are taking it again this year</b>:</p>
<p>According to the faculty regulations, students who failed this course must follow the rules for the current academic year. Thus: </p>
<ul class="nice_list">
<li>Until the 14th of October 2016, they must contact a teaching assistant and be included in a laboratory group </li>
<li>The student must do again all the laboratory work, must come to the practical examination, the mid-term control paper 
and the written exam and get grades above 5</li>
<li>All the rules presented above are valid also for students who already failed this course in the past</li>
</ul>
