<h2>8086 Interrupts</h2>
<br/>

An interrupt is an electrical signal sent by the computing system which signalizes the occurrence
of "an unusual event".
<br/><br/>

<p> 
There can be maximum 256 interrupts. Each interrupt has an associated procedure called Interrupt Handling Routine (IHR)
which is executed when that specific interrupt occurs. Not all 256 possible interrupts are defined.
</p>
 
<p>
When an interrupt is detected, the CPU does the following:
<ul>
    <li>suspend the execution of the current program</li>
    <li>calls the Interrupt Handling Routine for that interrupt</li>
    <li>resumes the execution of the suspended program (in most cases)</li>
</ul>
The handling of an interrupt is done only in between 2 consecutive machine instructions.
</p>
 
<p>
Depending on the causes that generate them, interrupts are classified in :
<ol>
	<li>interrupts external to the CPU: key pressed, completion of an input/output operation</li>
	<li>interrupts internal to the CPU: division by zero, trying to access a memory area which does not exist, trying to execute an instruction with no operation code</li>
</ol>

Depending on the level on which interrupts are defined, they can be grouped in: 
<ol>
	<li>hardware interrupts. The IHRs are written by the hardware circuits manufacturers and are stored in the memory of these hardware circuits.<br/>
            Ex:<ul>
            <li>interrupt 00h - is generated after a division by 0</li>
	    <li>interrupt 01h - is generated after each machine instruction if TF=1 (TrapFlag). This interrupt is used by debuggers like the Turbo Debuger.</li>
	    <li>interrupt 08h - the time interrupt. It is generated once in 55 milliseconds. </li>
	    </ul>
	</li> 

	<li>BIOS interrupts. The IHRs of these interrupts are written by the BIOS chipset manufacturers.<br/>
            Ex:<ul>
	    <li>interrupt 10h - supports working with the screen in graphic or text mode</li>
	    <li>interrupt 11h - provides information on the external devices installed on the system</li>
	    <li>interrupt 12h - provides information on the size of the RAM memory</li>
	    <li>interrupt 13h - supports working with the hard-disk</li>
	    </ul>
	</li> 	
	<li>DOS interrupts. The IHRs of these interrupts are written by the Operating System designers.<br/>
            Ex:<ul>
	    <li>interrupt 20h - ends a program.</li>
	    <li>interrupt 21h - provides the DOS system functions</li>
	    <li>interrupt 33h - working with the mouse</li>
	    </ul>
 	</li>
	<li>user-defined interrupts.</li>
</ol>
 
<p>
The routines of some soft interrupts can handle the interrupt differently for different values 
placed in the AH register. In these cases, we say that the interrupt provides several functions.
</p>
 
<p>
Example 1:
Using function 02h of the interrupt 21h we can display a character on the screen. The IHR of this
interrupt expects in AH the function code (02h) and in DL the ASCII code of the character
to be printed on the screen.
<br/><br/>

mov ah, 02h <br/>
mov dl, 'A' <br/>
int 21h  ; the instruction 'int' makes the CPU generate interrupt 21h<br/>
<br/>
The effect of these instructions is that the 'A' character is displayed on the screen.

 

<p><b>Observations:</b>
<ul>
    <li>The complete list of all interrupts and functions is found in the Norton Guide. It is advised that every student reads this
list (just reading, not memorizing it). The student does not need to know the interrupts by heart, but he/she must be able to
search efficiently in the Norton Guide for an interrupt which provides a specific thing.</li>
    <li>Some interrupts are "reserved". These are interrupts for which the computing system designers did not make available any
specifications either because these interrupts can lead to unpredictable behavior or their specification can change from 
one version of the system to the other. Students should avoid using this kind of interrupts.</li>
    <li>Some interrupts might not work as expected in the Windows operating environment.</li>
</ul>
